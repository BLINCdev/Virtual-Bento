# Virtual Bento
The Virtual Bento Arm is a complementary platform to the [physical Bento Arm](https://github.com/blincdev/Bento-Arm-Hardware) especially designed for myoelectric training and research applications. The latest release of this software includes a realistic simulation of the Bento Arm that can be viewed on an LCD monitor or laptop display, adjustable camera views, and six tasks, five of which include objects that the arm can interact with as part of a virtual environment. It can be run in a standalone mode using keyboard input or driven by an external software such as [brachI/Oplexus](https://github.com/BLINCdev/brachIOplexus) to unlock additional features such as adjustable joint limits and more input devices. Future releases will include more gripper options, virtual reality headset support, and additional tasks.

## Getting Started
Instructions for installing, running, and modifying the software can be found in [Virtual_Bento_User_Guide.pdf](https://github.com/blincdev/virtual-bento/blob/master/Virtual_Bento_User_Guide.pdf) The user guide will be your main goto document while setting up the software for the first time and includes references to the other files in the repository:

* __Virtual_Bento_V1.zip:__ The standalone build files that can be used to run the Virtual Bento Arm without any additional software. Also available from the [releases tab](https://github.com/blincdev/virtual-bento/releases)
* __virtual_bento.sln:__ The main visual studio project file for opening the source code. The project was built in (Unity Version  2020.1.0b5).
